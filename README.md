## Introduction

- This project was developed in order to achieve the learning outcomes for the course, The First Single-Page App, from Hyper Island.
  We have a received a prototype from the industry leader, in which we had to re-create and add some functionality using a [React](https://reactjs.org/) application. Thou we have used a [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) for this project, it still runs on react with some extra functionality out of the box, including SEO optimization and other cool features.

  ### What is React?

- A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, that uses a component based structure that works in a DECLARATIVE way, making the
  process of building applications a lot easier and seamless.

### What is NextJS?

- Next.js is a flexible (React framework) that gives you building blocks to create fast web applications, which provides a bunch of
  features out of the box.

## ES7 Syntax

- In this project we have made use of several modern JavaScript syntax elements, such as arrow functions, components, props and so on.

## NPM Packages

### What is NPM?

- NPM or Node Package Manager is used in a development environment to add extra packages to your application.
  NPM is also used to manage React applications, for example: spinning the development server or building your project for
  production. It's a very useful tool managed and created by the NODE team.

### Packages used in this project:

- [Ant Design](https://ant.design/)\
  It provides some stable and highly reusable UI components, making the development phase smoother.

- [sass](https://sass-lang.com/)\
  Sass is a CSS pre-processor. Sass reduces repetition of CSS and therefore saves time. (You can nest CSS styles as well)

- [react-responsive-carousel](http://react-responsive-carousel.js.org/)\
  Powerful, lightweight and fully customizable carousel component for React applications.

- [hamburger-react](https://hamburger-react.netlify.app/)\
  Hamburger menu icons for React, with CSS-driven transitions. Created to be as elegant as possible. This means no JavaScript animations, no transitions on non-cheap properties and a small size.

- [react-simple-typewriter](https://react-simple-typewriter.vercel.app/?path=/story/introduction--page)\
  A simple react component for adding a nice typewriter effect to your project

- [react-timer-hook](https://github.com/amrlabib/react-timer-hook#readme)\
  React timer hook is a custom react hook, built to handle timer, stopwatch, and time logic/state in your react component.
  - `useTimer`: Timers (countdown timer)
  - `useStopwatch`: Stopwatch (count up timer)
  - `useTime`: Time (return current time)
